# DiscordDiffs
This is where I will post all my diffs for discord. I do these in my own time and whenever I feel like it. 
I may go back and remake old diffs but I doubt it.

Feel free to contribute to this repo in any way. Even if it's suggesting a new colour scheme for the diffs. 

I might make releases but generally, you should simply download the HTML file "fullDiff", or "diffClasses"

The 'Find > Replace' is something that I do manually. It takes much more time and I don't care to be doing that type of diff anymore. 
This is where the new diffClasses.htm come into play.
